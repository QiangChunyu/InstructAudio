        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-music (TTM) models face significant limitations in instruction-based control. TTS systems usually depend on reference audio for timbre, offer only limited text-level attribute control, and rarely support dialogue generation. TTM systems are constrained by input conditioning requirements that depend on expert knowledge annotations. The high heterogeneity of these input control conditions makes them difficult to joint modeling with speech synthesis. Despite sharing common acoustic modeling characteristics, these two tasks have long been developed independently, leaving open the challenge of achieving unified modeling through natural language instructions. We introduce InstructAudio, a unified framework that enables instruction-based (natural language descriptions) control of acoustic attributes including timbre (gender, age), paralinguistic (emotion, style, accent), and musical (genre, instrument, rhythm, atmosphere). It supports expressive speech, music, and dialogue generation in English and Chinese. The model employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers with a standardized instruction-phoneme input format, trained on 50K hours of speech and 20K hours of music data, enabling multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment. Fig. 1 visualizes performance comparisons with mainstream TTS and TTM models, demonstrating that InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics. To our best knowledge, InstructAudio represents the first instruction-controlled framework unifying speech and music generation.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Experiment</h2>
        <p>This page shows the samples in the paper "<span class="highlight">InstructAudio</span>: Unified speech and music generation with natural language instruction".</p>

        <p>All test samples and speakers have not appeared in the training set and validation set.</p>

        <p>During inference, we employ a straightforward yet effective method to estimate total duration. Since speech rate strongly correlates with both age and emotion, we compute the average duration per phoneme for different age-emotion combinations (e.g., youth-happy) from the training set. At inference time, we perform keyword matching on the instruction text and calculate the total duration by multiplying the number of phonemes by the corresponding average duration. When no keywords match, we default to the global average phoneme duration.</p>

        <p>For CosyVoice2, which lacks text-based control for timbre attributes (gender, age), we provide reference audio that matches timbre description during inference and map inputs to its supported short-form control text (e.g., "Please speak very happy").</p>

        <p>Note that DiffRhythm+ does not support music synthesis under 90 seconds; therefore, we generate longer sequences and truncate them to create test samples, which may introduce evaluation bias.</p>

This framework enables multi-attribute control through natural language instructions. The input format remains consistent across different tasks, comprising a natural language instruction description along with corresponding text or lyrics. Audio is represented using continuous latents extracted from a pre-trained Mel-VAE. During inference, the VAE latent of the target speech or music is obtained through an ODE solver.</figcaption>
